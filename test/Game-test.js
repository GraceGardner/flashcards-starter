// Playing the Game
//
// Now that we have all of our classes and methods set up, we can connect this to the pre-existing code to make the game playable through the CLI (Command-Line-Interface).
//
// Game
//
// As you may have noticed, your Game class has two methods fleshed out already: printMessage and printQuestion. We are going to abandon testing for these methods - as the techniques for this type of testing are beyond the scope of this project.
//
// Your Game class should meet these other requirements:
// Should keep track of the currentRound
// start: method that starts everything
// Creates Cards
// Puts Cards in a Deck
// Creates a new Round using the Deck
// invokes printMessage to display the message in the CLI
// invokes printQuestion to kick off our helper functions that allow interaction via the CLI
// Note: The helper functions are all fleshed out and fit to work with classes/methods that meet the requirements in the past iterations.
//
// Look at the file being run when we want to start the game. Think about where you need to invoke your Game.start method.
